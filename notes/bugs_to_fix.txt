When testing, trying to execute a command that opens a buffer, like nano, causes the program to crash, because a session is needed,
this is simply just playing and toying around with telegram Bot APIs, using HTTPS and parsing messages, so this crashes the system and the bot, which is really really dangerous, I must find a way to circumvent the issue, either diverting this kind of command,
into a proper session, or being careful knwoing this weakness of trat.

When using the /download command, if the link is not valid, empty, or dummy the downnload does not fail and the thread does not detach, this must be fixed.


Impliment a functionality where the command /execute is with a bianry, it downloads it in a seperate thread, and until that threads finishes, it joins it and then executes it.

Impliment an ls, rm, cd, and /shell [command] functionalities.

Impliment the emailer, where we can pass special large files to be sent over emails proctocols.

find a way to hide critical sensitive info constants and vairiables, in the binary of this program such us the token, the clientId, the email adress and the password.
