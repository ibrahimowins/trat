**T-RAT** is  a remote access tools that ues the telegram bot api, to transmit commands and responses, designed to be minimal, frugal and fully functional.

**This is an experimental tool and repository**.

**Why C++**
Simply for the OOP , cross plaform multi-threading,namespaces, refernces.., basically I am coding in a C with classes, with namesapces ..., making developpement easier.
Everything uses Stack memory, except what the developper of telebot used.
