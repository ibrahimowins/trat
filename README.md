**T-RAT** is a remote access tool that uses the Telegram Bot API to transmit commands and responses. It is designed to be minimal, frugal, and fully functional.

**This is an experimental tool and repository.**

### Why C++?
Simply for the OOP, cross-platform multi-threading, namespaces, references... Essentially, I am coding in C with classes, namespaces, and other features, making development easier.  
Everything uses stack memory, except for what the developer of Telebot has used.

### Semantic Conventions:
1. **Macros** are all in uppercase, separated by underscores (`_`).
2. **Variable names** are in `snake_case`.
3. **Parameters** use `CamelCase` with underscores between words, e.g., `size_t Array_Size`.
4. **Function and method names** are in `camelCase`, e.g., `int doSomething()`.
5. **Special user types** are in `PascalCase`, e.g., `class ClassTypeExample`.
6. **Pointers** are prefixed with `p_` or `P_`, with numbers added for multi-level pointers: `p2_`, `P2_`, `p3_`, `P3_`, etc.
